# Dealing-With-Imbalanced-Data
Using Imblearn To Tackle Imbalanced Data Sets

Imbalanced data is a frequently occuring feature of data sets found in various fields such as epidemiology, marketing and fraud detection. Here I show examples of some methods for dealing with such
data. The data used came from the KEEL data set repository. I used a data set called 'yeast3' which had a class imbalance ratio of 1:8.1.

Resources used:

1) Imbalanced-learn documentation.

2) Data mining with imbalanced class distributions concepts and methods (Prati et al 2009).
